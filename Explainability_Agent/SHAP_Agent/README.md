🧩 Explainability Agent – SHAP (Popper Framework)
📖 Overview

This notebook implements the SHAP Agent under the Popper Framework for computational skepticism and AI validation.

The SHAP Agent is part of the Explainability Agents class, addressing the Black Box Problem in AI. It uses Shapley values from cooperative game theory to provide global and local explanations for machine learning models, helping us understand which features influence predictions, how strongly, and how consistently across models.

🎯 Purpose

Generate feature importance explanations for model predictions.

Translate opaque model behavior into interpretable visual insights.

⚙️ Capabilities Implemented

✔️ Shapley value calculation for features – quantifies each feature’s contribution to predictions.
✔️ Global explanation generation – summary plots show feature importance across the dataset.
✔️ Local explanation generation – force plots and waterfall plots explain individual predictions.
✔️ Feature interaction analysis – interaction values reveal how features combine in tree models.
✔️ Visualization of contribution magnitudes – beeswarm, bar, and force plots for clear interpretability.
✔️ Feature importance comparison across models – compares average SHAP values across multiple trained models.

This aligns directly with the SHAP Agent specification in the Popper framework.

🛠️ Workflow

1. Data Preparation

Loads the Breast Cancer dataset (binary classification).

Splits into training and test sets.

2. Model Training

Two representative models are trained:

RandomForestClassifier (tree-based model).

LogisticRegression with standard scaling.

3. SHAPAgent Class

A robust wrapper around the SHAP library with support for:

TreeExplainer (tree-based models).

LinearExplainer (linear/pipeline models).

Generic fallback explainer for others.

Functions for global, local, interaction, and cross-model explanations.

4. Global Explanations

SHAP summary plots show average feature importance.

Bar plots visualize magnitude contributions.

5. Local Explanations

Force plot and waterfall plot illustrate why a single prediction was made.

6. Feature Interaction Analysis

For tree-based models, computes interaction values to show how features combine.

7. Cross-Model Comparison

Compares feature importance rankings across RandomForest and Logistic Regression.

Helps identify agreement/disagreement between different model families.

📊 Example Outputs

Summary Plot (Global): Feature importance across the dataset.

Bar Plot (Global): Top features by mean absolute SHAP value.

Force Plot (Local): Individual prediction breakdown.

Waterfall Plot (Local): Cumulative contribution visualization.

Interaction Plot: Pairwise feature effects.

Cross-Model Bar Plot: Comparing RandomForest vs Logistic Regression importances.

🧪 Alignment with Popper Framework

Philosophical Foundation: Addresses the Black Box Problem – "Is understanding necessary for trust?"

Critical Question: Are SHAP explanations genuine signals of model reasoning, or just persuasive post-hoc rationalizations?

Educational Value: Provides hands-on experience in explainable AI, testing what actually works in practice for interpretability.

🚀 Next Steps

Extend to additional models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Nets).

Integrate counterfactual explanations alongside SHAP.

Compare SHAP explanations with LIME for robustness testing.

Explore bias detection in explanations (e.g., fairness metrics).
