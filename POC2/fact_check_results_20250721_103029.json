The TME, the environment surrounding the cancer cells, is a heterogeneous mixture of immune cells, endothelial cells, materials secreted from cells and their organelles, and fibroblasts.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), play an important role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Unlike normal fibroblasts, CAFs exhibit markedly different characteristics that promote tumorigenesis.\n\n    Morphological and Functional Characteristics of CAFs\n\n    CAFs, unlike normal fibroblasts (NF), are not passive bystanders.
