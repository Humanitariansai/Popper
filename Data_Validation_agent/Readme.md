Data Validation Popper Agent

This repository contains a Data Validation Popper Agent, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The agent is designed to automatically check datasets for common data quality issues, generate validation reports, and assist in fact-checking or integrity analysis.

📌 **Features**

- **Automated Data Validation:** Detects missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and outliers.
- **Customizable Rules:** Define validation logic specific to your dataset (e.g., numeric ranges, categorical constraints).
- **Data Integrity Reports:** Summarizes validation results in structured output for quick review.
- **Extensible Design:** Can be extended to include domain-specific checks or integrated into larger pipelines.

🗂 **Project Structure**

- `datavalidation_popper.ipynb`   — Main notebook containing the agent implementation
- `README.md`                     — Project documentation

🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository**
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/datavalidation_popper.git
	cd datavalidation_popper
	```

2. **Install dependencies**

	It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

	Typical dependencies include:
	- pandas
	- numpy
	- scikit-learn
	- matplotlib / seaborn (optional for visualization)
	- great-expectations (optional for advanced validation)

3. **Run the notebook**

	Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
	```bash
	jupyter notebook
	```

	Open `datavalidation_popper.ipynb` and execute the cells step by step.

⚙️ **Usage**

- Load your dataset into the notebook (.csv, .xlsx, or database source).
- Configure validation rules (e.g., no nulls in primary key, numeric columns within ranges).
- Run the validation cells to generate a report of detected issues.
- Optionally, export the results as a structured file (.csv, .json) for further processing.

📊 **Example**

Input dataset: Customer records

Checks performed:
- Missing customer IDs
- Invalid email formats
- Out-of-range ages

Output: Validation summary with flagged records for correction.

🔧 **Extending the Agent**

- Add new validation rules as Python functions.
- Integrate with ETL pipelines (Airflow, Prefect) for automated checks.
- Use in conjunction with ML model pipelines to ensure training data integrity.
